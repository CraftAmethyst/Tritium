<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

  construction
- **[All Versions]** Leaf Culling: Ports OptiFine's smart foliage rendering options
- **[All Versions]** Entity Stacking Optimization: Merges nearby dropped items and experience orbs when entity density
  is high, similar to Spigot's optimization
- **[All Versions]** Chest Rendering Optimization: Replaces dynamic chest models with static block geometry (removes
  opening animations for better performance)
- **[All Versions]** Distant Entity Tick Reduction: Stops ticking entities and fluids that are far from the player
- **[All Versions]** Dynamic FPS: Automatically reduces framerate when the game window is unfocused (1 FPS) or
  minimized (pauses rendering)
